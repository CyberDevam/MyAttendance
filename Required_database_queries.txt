Perfect 👍
Below is clean, viva-ready MySQL SQL code for your Attendance Management System (Admin + Teacher + Student, Monthly Attendance).
You can copy-paste this directly into phpMyAdmin / MySQL Workbench.

📘 Database Creation
CREATE DATABASE attendance_system;
USE attendance_system;
👤 Admin Table
CREATE TABLE admin (
    admin_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
👨‍🏫 Teachers Table
CREATE TABLE teachers (
    teacher_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
👨‍🎓 Students Table
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    roll_no VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    division VARCHAR(10),
    semester INT,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
📚 Subjects Table
CREATE TABLE subjects (
    subject_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    subject_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    semester INT NOT NULL,
    teacher_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers(teacher_id)
        ON DELETE SET NULL
);
🗓 Attendance Table
CREATE TABLE attendance (
    attendance_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT NOT NULL,
    subject_id INT NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('P','A') NOT NULL,
    
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (subject_id) REFERENCES subjects(subject_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE,

    UNIQUE (student_id, subject_id, date)
);
✔ UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate attendance for same day

🔐 (Optional but Recommended) User Sessions / Login Security
If your teacher asks about security, you can mention sessions + password hashing.

Example password hashing (PHP)
$password = password_hash($_POST['password'], PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
📊 Sample Queries (For Viva)
Mark Attendance
INSERT INTO attendance (student_id, subject_id, date, status)
VALUES (1, 2, '2026-01-15', 'P');
Update Attendance
UPDATE attendance
SET status = 'A'
WHERE student_id = 1 AND subject_id = 2 AND date = '2026-01-15';
Student Monthly Attendance Percentage
SELECT 
    MONTH(date) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS total_classes,
    SUM(status='P') AS present_days,
    (SUM(status='P') / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS attendance_percentage
FROM attendance
WHERE student_id = 1
GROUP BY MONTH(date);
🧠 One-Line DB Explanation (Use This in Viva)
“The database uses relational tables with foreign keys to maintain role-based access and ensure data integrity for attendance records.”

If you want next, I can:

✅ Write PHP attendance marking logic

✅ Give Chart.js monthly graph code

✅ Create ER diagram labels

✅ Provide full project report content

Just tell me what’s next 🚀
