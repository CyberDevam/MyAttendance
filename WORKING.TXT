Yes — 100% possible, and what you described is actually a very solid, well-structured academic system. 👍Your flow makes sense, is secure, and fits HTML + CSS + JS + PHP + MySQL + Bootstrap perfectly.
Below is a clean system flow + tech stack + role-wise access you can directly use in your project documentation.

📘 Attendance Management System (Monthly, Role-Based)
👥 User Roles
1. Admin
2. Teacher
3. Student
Each role has separate access and permissions.

🔐 Role-Based Access Control (Important for Viva)
Feature	Admin	Teacher	Student
Login	✅	✅	✅
Add/Edit Students	✅	❌	❌

Add Division / Semester	✅	❌	❌
Mark Attendance	❌	✅	❌
Edit Attendance	❌	✅	❌
View Attendance Reports	✅	✅	❌

🧩 Table Relationship (Explain Like This)
Relationships:
* Admin → Students (1 : Many)
* Admin → Teachers (1 : Many)
* Teacher → Subjects (1 : Many)
* Student → Attendance (1 : Many)
* Subject → Attendance (1 : Many)

📊 Student Attendance Graph Flow
Student Login
      ↓
Fetch Attendance (student_id)
      ↓
Group by Month (PHP)
      ↓
Send JSON Data
      ↓
Chart.js Graph
✔ Student only sees own data using student_id from session.

🧠 One-Line Diagram Explanation (For Examiner)
“The system uses role-based flow where admin manages academic entities, teachers record attendance, and students securely view their monthly attendance graph fetched from the database.”

📌 How to Draw This for Submission
Use:
* draw.io
* MS PowerPoint
* Lucidchart
Redraw:
* Rectangles → Processes
* Diamonds → Decisions (optional)
* Arrows → Flow

If you want next, I can:
* Convert this into ER Diagram
* Give SQL CREATE TABLE
* Write attendance marking PHP logic
* Create Chart.js code
Just say the word 🚀
